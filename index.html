  <h1> My Favorite Hobby is <br> Drawing </h1> 
I love drawing!
  </section>

  <section id="bio"> <div class="line"> </div>
<p> My hobby is to try to draw cool things in my free time or when I am asked to. I am not that good at drawing. So if I want to draw something, I look at a tutorial and draw from there. Drawing helps me get relaxed if I had a bad or busy day. I also love to draw something cool and interesting when it is someone's birthday. I mostly like to draw a folding surprise or a detailed drawing. A folding surprise is a drawing where you have to fold the paper before drawing. If you don't unfold the paper after drawing, you will not see the whole picture. If you unfold the paper after drawing, then you will see the whole picture. There is a trick to draw folding surprises and it is very fun and cool. I also like to draw detailed drawings. I drew a detailed owl once and it looks so pretty and it is so visually appealing to the eye. Even though I am not that good at drawing, I still draw because it makes me happy! </p>

<p> Vincent Van Gogh inspires me to draw. He was a wonderful painter with beautiful masterpieces like "The Starry Night" and "The Van Gogh self-portrait. He was a very nice painter and he will always inspire people like me because of his out of the world paintings! </p>
